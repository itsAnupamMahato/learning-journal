### Code Examples

#### 1. Machine Learning - Linear Regression

```markdown
# Linear Regression üìä

**Overview**: Linear Regression is a fundamental supervised learning algorithm used to predict a continuous target variable based on one or more predictors.

### Key Concepts
- **Formula**: `Y = mX + b`, where `m` is the slope, and `b` is the intercept.
- **Cost Function**: Minimizes the error between predicted and actual values.
- **Gradient Descent**: An optimization algorithm to find the best-fit line.

### Code Example
```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Sample data
X = np.array([[1], [2], [3], [4]])
y = np.array([3, 5, 7, 9])

# Model
model = LinearRegression().fit(X, y)
print("Coefficient:", model.coef_)
print("Intercept:", model.intercept_)

#### 2. Data Visualization - Matplotlib Basics

```markdown
# Matplotlib Basics üìà

**Overview**: Matplotlib is a powerful library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.

### Key Concepts
- **Plotting Basics**: Line plots, bar charts, and scatter plots.
- **Customization**: Adding labels, legends, and changing colors.
- **Subplots**: Displaying multiple charts in a single figure.

### Code Example
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Data
x = [1, 2, 3, 4]
y = [10, 20, 25, 30]

# Plotting
plt.plot(x, y, label="Sample Data", color="blue")
plt.xlabel("X-axis")
plt.ylabel("Y-axis")
plt.legend()
plt.show()

#### 3. Web Development - HTML & CSS Basics

```markdown
# HTML & CSS Basics üåê

**Overview**: Understanding the structure of HTML for web pages and styling them using CSS.

### Key Concepts
- **HTML Structure**: Elements, tags, and attributes.
- **CSS Styling**: Selectors, colors, and fonts.
- **Responsive Design**: Making pages adaptable to different devices.

### Example
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Sample Page</title>
    <style>
        body { font-family: Arial, sans-serif; }
        h1 { color: navy; }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Sample Page</h1>
    <p>This is a basic HTML and CSS example.</p>
</body>
</html>
